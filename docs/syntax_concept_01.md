# Code Description

The following code is a first draft to demonstrate basic language constructs such as variables, constants, loops, and return values:

```rust
fn main() -> i64 {
  let index : i64 = 0;
  const b : string = "Hallo World";
  let ar: [i64; index] = [0; index]; // An array of size 11, initialized with zeros

  while( index < 11){
    ar[index as usize] = index * 2; // Example: storing double the index value
    index += 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Key Aspects

1. **Function `main`**: The main function returns a value of type `i64`, indicating a clear return type definition.
2. **Variable `index`**: Initialized with the value `0`. The type `i64` suggests an integer variable with a large range.
3. **Constant `b`**: Holds the string "Hallo World". This defines a constant value that cannot be changed.
4. **Array `ar`**: A fixed-size array of size `index`, initialized with zeros. This demonstrates dynamic array sizing and indexing.
5. **Loop**: A simple `while` loop that runs until `index` reaches the value `11`, updating the array `ar` with calculated values.
6. **Return Value**: The function ends with a return value of `0`, which typically indicates successful execution.

## Notes

This code is intended as a first draft. Some improvements are possible:

- The constant `b` is not used and could either be removed or utilized.
- The array `ar` is introduced to demonstrate storage of values calculated within the loop.
- The syntax for string types (`string`) might need to be adjusted depending on the target language, as not all languages support this notation.

## EBNF Definition

The following EBNF definition represents the structure of the code. The starting rule is `translation_unit`, and it is designed to be LL(1) compatible:

```
translation_unit ::= (function)*
function ::= "fn" identifier "(" ")" "->" type "{" statements "}"
statements ::= (statement)*
statement ::= variable_declaration | constant_declaration | loop | return_statement
variable_declaration ::= "let" identifier ":" type "=" expression ";"
constant_declaration ::= "const" identifier ":" type "=" expression ";"
loop ::= "while" "(" condition ")" "{" statements "}"
return_statement ::= "return" expression ";"
expression ::= integer | string_literal | array_initialization | binary_expression
array_initialization ::= "[" expression ";" expression "]"
binary_expression ::= identifier operator expression
condition ::= binary_expression
identifier ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/
integer ::= /\d+/
string_literal ::= /".*"/
operator ::= "<" | "=" | "+" | "*" | "/"
type ::= "i64" | "string" | "[i64;" identifier "]"
```
